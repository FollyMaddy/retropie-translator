# retropie-translator
Recognises Japanese text and translates from screenshots made during emulating
Default setup uses the "Print Screen key" for making screenshots.

install :
git clone https://github.com/FollyMaddy/retropie-translator
cd retropie-translator
bash translate_setup.sh

still WIP :
how to run this program together with emulationstation.

When using libretro-cores a shader "xbr-lv1-noblend" is preffered for better recognition (but is slow).
(use hotkey "n" and "m" to change between shaders)
